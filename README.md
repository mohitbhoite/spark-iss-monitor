=================

The project notifies over an 8x8 LED Matrix display whenever the International Space Station is passing over you.

You can watch it in action [here.](http://youtu.be/oPaFNXm0eTI?list=UURBc18ggB23ryfJhkhiPGIw)

#### Wiring diagram

Please note that the display used in the actual project was the bigger [1.2" 8x8 display with backpack from Adafruit.](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1052) I did not have the fritzing part for it, so ended up using the smaller one here; but the wiring remains the same.
